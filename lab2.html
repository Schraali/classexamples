<h2>Why are Chinook salmon Declining?</h4>
<h5>    By Alina Schrader</h2>

<h3>Urban Development</h3>

<p>Urban devlopment is a leading factor that contributes
the to the decreasement of the Chinook Salmon population and their body sizes.

<p>A few different buildings and their affects on salmon are shown in the table below.

<! –– Overfishing -->

<h3>Overfishing</h3>

<p>The overharvesting and fishing of Chinook salmon
 can impact their population and individual sizes dramatically.
 <br>
 
 <em>This is esepecially evident when faced with these two statistics and the many others like them.<em>

 <ul>
  <li>according to a 2012 study by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife,
      commercial sport and tribal fishing reduces the amount of four and five-year-old
      Chinook salmon by about 20%.
  <li>from 1975 to 2010, almost 20 million Chinook have been harvested for commercial,
      sport or subsistence and ceremonial fisheries.
 </ul>

<! –– Fish Hatcheries -->
  
  <h3>Overfishing</h3>
  
<p>Fish hatcheries can also dwindle the number of Chinook Salmon out there.
 <br>
 
 Fish hatcheries damage Salmon in a several ways.
<br>
 
<ol>
<li>Millions of salmon with genetic similarities are released
    into the oceans from these hatcheries</li>
 <ul>
<li>This will make them less able to have certain strands of salmon
    survive environment changes</li>
<li>And can also cause increased competition between wild and hatchery stocks</li>
 </ul>
 <ol>
  <li>Most fish leaving Washington waters, especially the Columbia, head northward in
      their migration, where many are later caught in mixed-stock ocean fisheries<\li>
  <ul>
<li>This is a prominant reason for the decrease in salmon</li>
  </ul>
