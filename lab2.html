 <h3><em>Urban Development</em></h3>

<p><em>Urban devlopment</em> is a leading factor that contributes
the to collapsing Chinook Salmon population and their body sizes.

<p><b>A few different buildings and their effects on salmon are shown in the table below.</b>

     <td>Blocks access to spawning habitat</td>
     <td>Erodes Gravel and debre onto spawning beds</td>
     <td>Storm water runoff pollutes salmon waters</td>

<! –– Overfishing -->

<h3><em>Overfishing</em></h3>

<p>The <em>overharvesting</em> and <em>fishing</em> of Chinook salmon
 impacts their population and individual sizes dramatically.
 <br>
 <br>
 
<b>This is especially evident when faced with these two statistics and the many others like them.</b>

 <ul>
  <li>According to a 2012 study by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife,
      commercial sport and tribal fishing reduces the amount of four and five-year-old
   Chinook salmon by about <b>20%</b>.
  <li>From 1975 to 2010, almost <b>20 million Chinook</b> have been harvested for commercial,
      sport or subsistence and ceremonial fisheries.
 </ul>

<! –– Fish Hatcheries -->
  
 <h3><em>Fish Hatcheries</em></h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Fish Hatchery Definition</dt><dd>A place for artificial breeding, hatching, and rearing through the early life
 stages of different aquatic life</em></dd>
 
<br>

<b>Fish hatcheries damage Salmon in a several ways:</b>
<br>

<ol>
<li>Millions of salmon with genetic similarities are released
    into the oceans from these hatcheries</li>
 <ul>
<li>This will make Chinook salmon less able to
    survive environment changes</li>
<li>This can also cause increased competition between wild and hatchery stocks</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Most fish leaving Washington waters, especially the Columbia, head northward in
  their migration, where many are later caught in mixed-stock ocean fisheries</li>
 <ul>
<li>This is a prominant reason for the decrease in salmon</li>
 </ul>
</ol>
