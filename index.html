  <title>Mr. Chan's first Website</title>
  <body bgcolor="orange">
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Welcome to my web page! This is the first example from class. I hope you like it.
    <p>Here's another paragraph.
    I typed this line without another paragraph tag, so it should appear right next to the previous sentence. The web page <b>doesn't</b> preserve the same spacing. It formats according to the tags it sees.
    So the line
    breaks
    are
    different
    from the 
    source
    also. <p><h2>But here is a <i>new</i> paragraph.</h2>
    <br><br>And a couple more blank lines afterward...
    <p>Here is information about <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html">McDonald's</a>
